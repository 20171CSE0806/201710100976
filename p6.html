		DBS Bank is a Singaporean multinational banking and financial services corporation headquartered in Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3, Marina Bay, Singapore. The company was known as The 			Development Bank of Singapore Limited, before the present name was adopted on 21 July 2003 to reflect its changing role as a regional bank.[5]

		The bank was set up by the Government of Singapore on 16 July 1968 to take over the industrial financing activities from the Economic Development Board. Today, its branches numbering more 			than 100 can be found island-wide. DBS Bank is the largest bank in South East Asia by assets and among the larger banks in Asia, with total assets of S$518 billion as at 31 Dec 2017. It 			has market-dominant positions in consumer banking, treasury and markets, asset management, securities brokerage, equity and debt fund-raising in Singapore and Hong Kong. DBS Bank's 			largest, and controlling, shareholder is Temasek Holdings, Singapore's second largest sovereign wealth fund (after GIC). As of 31 March 2018 Temasek owns 29% of DBS' shares.[6]

		The bank's strong capital position, as well as "AA-" and "Aa1" credit ratings by Standard & Poor's and Moody's that are among the highest in the Asia-Pacific region, earned it Global 			Finance's "Safest Bank in Asia" accolade for six consecutive years, from 2009 to 2015.[7][8] The Bank was also awarded the Best Digital Bank in the World in the year 2016 by Euromoney.[9] 			In July 2019, DBS became the first bank ever to concurrently hold three of the most prestigious global best bank honours (Euromoney, Global Finance, The Banker).[10] In addition, DBS Bank 			is listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index since 2 October 2018, making it the first bank in Southeast Asia to do so.
